# BODY MASS INDEX



Body Mass Index in short BMI is a Python terminal calculator which takes the user's information and, calculates their BMI as per their weight and height. It also identifies if their provided details are valid and at the end it informs the user if their weight is good as per the BMI or if they are overweight.
It is very clearly and simply designed software which is compatible to work on Heroku app.

here is live version of the [BODY MASS INDEX](https://body-mass-index.herokuapp.com/)


# How does it work:
It is very easy to use and understand, a userfiendly design where you just have to enter your details (Name, Age, Weight and Height) if any of the provided detail is incorrect it will warn you and give you a chance to try again to enter your details. Finally if all the details are correct and valid it will then calculate the BMI and print the results with a very brief message saying "Your weight is good as per bmi calculations" or "Sorry your weight it a bit high". The app does not store user's data or any other information and can be used multiple times. At the end it ask user's if he/she wants to continue using or end the programme.

# User Experience #

## User Stories ##
- As a user I would like an easy interface with clear instruction.
- As a user I would like the quiz to be difficult but fun.
- As a user I would like to be able to see the leaderboard. 
- As a user I would like to know my score and see how many points I can get.



## Wireframes ##
The initial wireframes were made on [Balsamiq](https://www.balsamiq.cloud). These wireframes of the quiz, show a somewhat less thought out design but shows how much I've built upon to make sure the UX is stronger.

I wanted to make this a really easy interface with little distraction to ensure the user has the best experience. 

## Flow Charts ##
I made the flow chart using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com). This again shows a little more thought out process including different difficulties which would be offered in a future build. It also details how only 10 questions would be shown, I decided in terms of a competitive user experience, its better to have one mode and compete for that top spot.

## Design Choices ##

### Typograghy ###
Although technically not typography, the font art I used within my project was imported using [art](https://pypi.org/project/art/). I wanted the main screen to stand out and this can be seen by all headings within the quiz game.

### Colour Choices ###
The colours I've chosen were inspired by the french flag. Mainly because when thinking of a standout group of colours for musical theatre, the french flag is such a prominant option due to the musical Les Miserables and it helps the screen pop out too. So I used the Linear gradient on [Gradient CSS](http://www.gradientcss.com/) to help me achieve this.

I also replicated this in the font colour choices for the most part of the quiz.
